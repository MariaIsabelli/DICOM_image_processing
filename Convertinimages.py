#Often in our work, we need to convert DICOM format into ordinary images and resize themâ€”for example, converting DICOM format into PNG image format.

#This option works but does not consider the metadata related to the image, especially concerning the BitsAllocated and PhotometricInterpretation values.

#The PhotometricInterpretation value determines the intended interpretation of the pixel data. Here, we are interested in the two main values of the X-ray:
#MONOCHROME1 is pixel data that represents a single monochrome image plane. The minimum sample value is intended to be displayed as white after any volume of interest (VOI) grayscale transformations are performed.
#MONOCHROME2 is pixel data that represents a single monochrome image plane. The minimum sample value is intended to be displayed as black after any VOI grayscale transformations are performed.
